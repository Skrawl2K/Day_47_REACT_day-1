    <h2>Publication history</h2>
    <p>The character made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963). After issue #99 (March 1968), the Tales of Suspense series was renamed Captain America. An Iron Man story appeared in the one-shot issue Iron Man and Sub-Mariner #1 (April 1968), before the "Golden Avenger" made his solo debut with Iron Man #1 (May 1968). The series' indicia gives its copyright title as Iron Man, while the trademarked cover logo of most issues is The Invincible Iron Man. Artist George Tuska began a decade-long association with the character with Iron Man #5 (Sept. 1968).[3] Writer Mike Friedrich and artist Jim Starlin's brief collaboration on the Iron Man series introduced Mentor, Drax, Starfox, and Thanos in issue #55 (Feb. 1973). Friedrich scripted a metafictional story in which Iron Man visited the San Diego Comic Convention and met several Marvel Comics writers and artists.[5] He then wrote the multi-issue "War of the Super-Villains" storyline which ran through 1975.</p>
